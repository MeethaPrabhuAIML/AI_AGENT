# AI_AGENT
## Project Title:
An AI Agent using LanGraph, Hugging face and deployed using Gradio
## Abstract
This project presents an AI Agent that generates simple cooking recipes based on user-provided ingredients. By leveraging the instruction-tuned FLAN-T5 model from Hugging Face, the agent understands natural language input and produces simple cooking instructions. An interactive web interface is provided via Gradio, allowing users to experiment with different combinations of ingredients and instantly receive recipe suggestions.

## Program
1. Built using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.
2. Uses the transformers library to load the flan-t5-base model.
3. Inputs a list of ingredients as text.
4. Constructs a prompt and queries the model.
5. Displays the result using a Gradio UI for easy interaction.
